# Ownership and implementation contract

Classification: proposed, until linked implementation and executable evidence exist.

The watchdog owns desired deployment mode, component supervision, job scheduling
records, operational audit, retry windows and approved release identity. Gateway
owns durable mutation authority, operation journals and game lifecycle. Harness
owns episodes, pending decisions, provider accounting and execution checkpoints.
MCP remains a thin harness-owned transport. The authoritative host fences queued
execution and supplies operation-specific effect witnesses.

Use a single Rust package with cohesive policy, storage, runtime, broker and CLI
modules initially. Pure policy consumes explicit time and observations. SQLite
WAL with synchronous FULL stores watchdog state on a local filesystem. A separate
singleton lock owns reconciliation; administrative commands transact desired mode
before process effects. Read-only status must never initialize missing state.

Incompatible recovery interfaces must have explicit versions and digests and be
integrated with their real consumers. Frozen runtime-v3 artifacts stay frozen.
No watchdog database is shared with gateway or harness. No watchdog action
directly mutates the game or treats changed observations as settlement evidence.

All production mutations require admission validation and bounded resources.
Persistence uncertainty blocks new work; unavailable telemetry does not grant
authority or cause whole-stack restarts. Stop, pause, quarantine and completed-job
records survive every recovery path. A process identity includes creation context
and launch identity; PID or executable name alone never authorizes termination.
